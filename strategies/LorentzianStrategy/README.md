## üìä Signal Generation Flow

The system follows this signal generation hierarchy:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Feature Calculation] -->|GPU Accelerated| B[Multi-timeframe Analysis]
    B -->|Weighted Signals| C[Signal Generation]
    D[Market Regime] -->|Adaptive Weights| C
    C -->|Final Signal| E[Position Management]
    F[Volatility Filter] -->|Risk Adjustment| E
```

A trade is executed when:
1. Feature calculations indicate a potential opportunity
2. Multi-timeframe analysis confirms the signal
3. Market regime and volatility conditions are favorable
4. Position sizing and risk parameters are satisfied

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Features

## üìñ Usage

```python
from strategies.LorentzianStrategy.models.primary.lorentzian_classifier import LorentzianClassifier
from strategies.LorentzianStrategy.features import RSIFeature, WaveTrendFeature

# Initialize features
rsi = RSIFeature(period=14)
wave_trend = WaveTrendFeature(channel_length=10)

# Initialize classifier
classifier = LorentzianClassifier()

# Process data
features = {
    'rsi': rsi.forward(close_prices),
    'wave_trend': wave_trend.forward(high_prices, low_prices, close_prices)
}

# Generate signals
signals = classifier.generate_signals(features)
```
